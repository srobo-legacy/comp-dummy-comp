  # Extra spacing before an arbitrary set of matches
  # This value is ignored for matches which occur at the start of a period
  # since no additional time is needed there. While it might seem nicer
  # to require the user to change the values in here, delays can push matches
  # from one period to the next which would make it hard for the user to
  # keep this up to date.
